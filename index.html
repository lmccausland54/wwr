            <p id = "homepage-text-one">Welcome to the home base for all of my manuscripts! I write blazing new narratives in fantastical science-fiction and fantasy worlds. 
                I started writing as a primary caregiver to a medically complex child, as a way to escape and as an outlet that was accessible from my kitchen table. 
                My stories often come to me in dreams first, then are further refined, often in multiple iterations before landing in their final form.
                 Writing has proved to be a critical part of who I am, and something I imagine doing for the rest of my life. 
            </p>
            <p id = "homepage-text-two">
                I adore exploring complex themes, relationships, and expansive world-building through multiple point-of-view storytelling. My stories feature strong female voices, 
                diverse casts of characters, thrill and suspense, and heart-achingly tender moments that pull you right into the world. 
            </p>  
            <p id = "homepage-text-three">
                Here you can find pages exploring my two current works-in-progress, learn more about the characters and the worlds, 
                and enjoy inspirational artwork as well. Enjoy, and never stop dreaming!
